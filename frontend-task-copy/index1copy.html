    <h2 class="header mt-2 mb-2">What is Cryptocurrencies</h2>
    <p id="paragraph">Cryptocurrency is a form of payment that can be exchanged online for
        goods and services.
        Many companies have issued their own currencies, often called tokens, and these can be traded specifically for
        the good or service that the company provides.
        Think of them as you would arcade tokens or casino chips. Youâ€™ll need to exchange real currency for the
        cryptocurrency to access the good or service.
